# ![Unist][logo]

**Uni**versal **S**yntax **T**ree.

***

**Unist** is the combination of three syntax trees, and more to come:
[**mdast**][mdast] with [**remark**][remark] for markdown, [**nlcst**][nlcst]
with [**retext**][retext] for prose, and [**hast**][hast] with
[**rehype**][rehype] for HTML.

This document explains some terminology relating to [**unified**][unified] and
[**vfile**][vfile] as well.

This document may not be released. See [releases][] for released
documents. The latest released version is [`1.1.0`](https://github.com/syntax-tree/unist/releases/tag/1.1.0).

## Unist nodes

Subsets of Unist can define new properties on new nodes, and plug-ins
and utilities can define new [`data`][data] properties on nodes.  But,
the values on those properties **must** be JSON values: `string`,
`number`, `object`, `array`, `true`, `false`, or `null`.  This means
that the syntax tree should be able to be converted to and from JSON
and produce the same tree.  For example, in JavaScript, a tree should
be able to be passed through `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(tree))` and
result in the same values.

See [**nlcst**][nlcst] for more information on **retext** nodes,
[**mdast**][mdast] for information on **remark** nodes, and
[**hast**][hast] for information on **rehype** nodes.

### `Node`

A Node represents any unit in the Unist hierarchy.  It is an abstract
interface.  Interfaces extending **Node** must have a `type` property,
and may have `data` or `position` properties.  `type`s are defined by
their namespace.

Subsets of Unist are allowed to define properties on interfaces which
extend Unist’s abstract interfaces.  For example, [mdast][] defines
**Link** ([Parent][]) with a `url` property.

```idl
interface Node {
  type: string;
  data: Data?;
  position: Position?;
}
```

#### `Data`

Data represents data associated with any node.  `Data` is a scope for
plug-ins to store any information.  For example, [`remark-html`][remark-html]
uses `hProperties` to let other plug-ins specify properties added to the
compiled HTML element.

```idl
interface Data { }
```

#### `Position`

**Position** references a range consisting of two points in a [Unist
file][file].  **Position** consists of a `start` and `end` point.
And, if relevant, an `indent` property.

When the value represented by a node is not present in the document
corresponding to the syntax tree at the time of reading, it must not
have positional information.  These nodes are said to be _generated_.

```idl
interface Position {
  start: Point;
  end: Point;
  indent: [uint32 >= 1]?;
}
```

#### `Point`

**Point** references a point consisting of two indices in a
[Unist file][file]: `line` and `column`, set to 1-based integers.  An
`offset` (0-based) may be used.

```idl
interface Point {
  line: uint32 >= 1;
  column: uint32 >= 1;
  offset: uint32 >= 0?;
}
```

### `Parent`

Nodes containing other nodes (said to be **children**) extend the
abstract interface **Parent** ([**Node**](#node)).

```idl
interface Parent <: Node {
  children: [Node];
}
```

### `Text`

Nodes containing a value extend the abstract interface **Text**
([**Node**](#node)).

```idl
interface Text <: Node {
  value: string;
}
```

## Glossary

###### Tree

A **tree** is a node and all of its [descendants][descendant] (if any).

###### Child

Node X is **child** of node Y, if Y’s `children` include X.

###### Parent

Node X is **parent** of node Y, if Y is a [child][] of X.

###### Index

The **index** of a [child][] is its number of preceding [siblings][sibling], or
`0` if it has none.

###### Sibling

Node X is a **sibling** of node Y, if X and Y have the same
[parent][parent-term] (if any).

The **previous sibling** of a [child][] is its **sibling** at its [index][]
minus 1.

The **next sibling** of a [child][] is its **sibling** at its [index][]
plus 1.

###### Root

The **root** of an object is itself, if without [parent][parent-term] or the
**root** of its [parent][parent-term].

The **root** of a [tree][] is any node in that [tree][] without
[parent][parent-term].

###### Descendant

Node X is **descendant** of node Y, if X is a [child][] of Y, or if X is a
[child][] of node Z that is a **descendant** of Y.

An **inclusive descendant** is a node or one of its **descendants**.

###### Ancestor

Node X is an **ancestor** of node Y, if Y is a [descendant][] of X.

An **inclusive ancestor** is a node or one of its **ancestors**.

###### Head

The **head** of a node is its first [child][] (if any).

###### Tail

The **tail** of a node is its last [child][] (if any).

## Unist files

**Unist files** are virtual files (such as [**vfile**][vfile])
representing documents at a certain location.  They are not limited to
existing files, nor to the file-system.

## Unist utilities

**Unist utilities** are functions which work with **unist nodes**,
agnostic of **remark**, **retext**, or **rehype**.

A list of **vfile**-related utilities can be found at [**vfile**][vfile].
